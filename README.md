# ionic-vercel-local-function-testing
Sample project to demonstrate issues with running vercel dev to test vercel cloud functions on a local machine via localhost

* This is a standard ionic angular app created using "ionic start".  
* I've added a single hello.ts function under /api and deployed to vercel.
* Now I want to test locally using "ionic serve" and I want to run the vercel functions under /api locally with "vercel dev".

## Issue #1
Running "vercel dev" in the project folder for the first time gives the error "The specified command ("start") is invalid" see below:
```

Did you mean "test"?
